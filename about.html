Although Downtwon Toronto has a lot of similarities like Taipei, there are still unique parts of Downtown that I found out recently where the spots could overturn the established impression of people who have been or are going to live here. That is what motivates us to create this website as our project for this introduction course. We hope to use what we learned in this course to display a
brand new and original website that could help everyone, whether they are the newcomers or permanant residants, to discover the "hidden gems" of Downtown Toronto.<br> If possible, we hope the list in the website could be continuously updated with the reviews of visitors of our websites, so Downtown Toronto could always be interesting for every visitor. Hopefully, my experiences in Downtown Toronto could provide some options onto the list too. </blockquote></div>
